## What are variables? 
- Names that are associated with concrete objects that are stored within your computers memory. 
- These can be called at any point within your code. 

## What is REPL?
REPL is a python interactive shell

- Read: The shell reads the statement that was specified. 
- Evaluate: Python then evaluates / processes the command.
- Print: Prints the result to the screen.
- Loop: Starts the process over again. 
## Creating a Variable

- In this example, you have the variable name that is on the left, followed by an assignment operator, followed by a value that you want to specify.  

```python
variable_name=value
```

Examples: 

```python
>>> word = "Python"
>>> number = 42
>>> coefficent = 2.87
>>> fruits = ["apple", "mango", "grape"]
>>> ordinals = {1: "first", 2: "second", 3: "third" }
```
